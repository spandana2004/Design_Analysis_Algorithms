## Introduction
This project is an implementation of various classical algorithms in Java, including sorting, searching, and graph algorithms. It focuses on both the correctness and performance analysis of algorithms, showcasing the time and space complexities. The project is useful for educational purposes, helping students and developers understand how different algorithms function and their performance characteristics.

## Objectives
- Implement classical algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph traversal.
- Provide a platform to analyze time and space complexities.
- Demonstrate algorithmic design paradigms such as **Divide and Conquer**, **Greedy algorithms**, and **Dynamic Programming**.

## Features
- Modular Java code for a wide range of algorithms.
- Detailed performance and complexity analysis.
- Easy-to-use interface to test algorithms with custom inputs.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans (or any Java-compatible IDE)
- **Testing**: JUnit (for unit testing algorithms)
- **Build Tool**: Maven / Gradle (optional)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-analysis-java.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, etc.).

3. Compile and run the project:
   - If using Maven:
     ```bash
     mvn clean install
     mvn exec:java
     ```
   - If using an IDE, locate `Main.java` and run it.

## Usage
1. Open the `Main.java` file to choose which algorithm to execute.
2. You can call individual algorithms from the main file to run specific operations like sorting, searching, or solving graph problems.
3. Test different input sizes to observe time complexity behaviors.
